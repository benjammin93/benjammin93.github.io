<p>Even a sane, healthy, and reasonably-handsome human being can only take the torture most businesses inflict upon them on a daily basis for so long. Poor customer service, inflexible contracts and policies along with slow, inefficient point of sale processes are enough dishearten even the most rugged of clientele. </p>

<p>It is a well known fact that consumers expect and demand high quality products and services, and they will turn around and <em>run somewhere else</em> if they are being treated like <em>second-class citizens</em> when they venture out into your realm of capitalism.</p>

<p><strong>In our modern age,</strong> it is simply <em>unacceptable</em> to let a fellow human being tumble through the cracks of <em>dirt-poor</em> web design/engineering and <em>crippled</em> customer management software (or <em>anything</em> running on Windows...) Even worse is to let your own business fall victim to the <strong>gaping hole</strong> of slow growth and limited profitability: </p>

<p>Problems like these are critical liabilities for businesses, leaving them with a steep disadvantage compared to the competition.</p>

<ul>
<li>Realtime Inventory and Employee Tracking</li>
<li>Consumer Trend Analysis</li>
<li>Automated Billing and Payments</li>
<li>Custom, Streamlined Point of Sale Applications</li>
</ul><p>Separated and disconnected from one another, these technologies do very little good. Incompatibility across computers and devices, redundancies in program functionality together with no global data persistence often create confusion and disrupt effective workflows. </p>

<p>However, when this tech stack is thoroughly planned, expertly engineered, lovingly customized, and personally installed, you'll be pleasantly surprised how much more enjoyable and rewarding managing your business can be - not only for you and your employees, but also for the countless new customers and clients who will return again and again!</p>
