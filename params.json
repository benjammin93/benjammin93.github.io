Poor customer service, inflexible contracts and policies along with slow, inefficient point of sale processes are enough dishearten even the most rugged of clientele. \r\n\r\nIt is a well known fact that consumers expect and demand high quality products and services, and they will turn around and _run somewhere else_ if they are being treated like _second-class citizens_ when they venture out into your realm of capitalism.\r\n\r\n**In our modern age,** it is simply _unacceptable_ to let a fellow human being tumble through the cracks of _dirt-poor_ web design/engineering and _crippled_ customer management software (or _anything_ running on Windows...) Even worse is to let your own business fall victim to the **gaping hole** of slow growth and limited profitability: \r\n##### **Zero Systems Integration.** \r\n\r\nProblems like these are critical liabilities for businesses, leaving them with a steep disadvantage compared to the competition.\r\n\r\n#### What is/are your solution(s), good sir?\r\n\r\n* Realtime Inventory and Employee Tracking\r\n* Consumer Trend Analysis\r\n* Automated Billing and Payments\r\n* Custom, Streamlined Point of Sale Applications\r\n\r\nSeparated and disconnected from one another, these technologies do very little good. Incompatibility across computers and devices, redundancies in program functionality together with no global data persistence often create confusion and disrupt effective workflows. \r\n\r\nHowever, when this tech stack is thoroughly planned, expertly engineered, lovingly customized, and personally installed, you'll be pleasantly surprised how much more enjoyable and rewarding managing your business can be - not only for you and your employees, but also for the countless new customers and clients who will return again and again!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## *We are POSUX.*\r\n\r\n##### We passionately develop intelligent, fully-featured, low-cost, and unbeatable cloud-based custom Point of Sale (POS) software.  \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## *Let's work together!*\r\n\r\n*No business is too big or too small.*\r\n\r\n\r\n#### *_Give us a call, send us a text, or shoot us email to benefit from our free consultation._*\r\n\r\n*Hope to hear from you soon!*\r\n\r\n\r\n-Benjamin Rabin, Founder and Entrepreneur, and the POSUX team!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
